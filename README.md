# Track the Attack: HTTPS, TLS, and Safer Logins

This project is an interactive teaching website designed for students with little or no networking background.  
It walks learners through what actually happens when you log in to a website, how HTTPS/TLS protects (and sometimes doesn’t protect) your data, and how different authentication methods change your risk.
